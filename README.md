# File-System-Task

Basically, in this task you can see, a Text file will be created with name as current date-time.txt and content would be current timestamp and i've set te localhost 
to 5000 to access both the details as you can see below,
http://localhost:5000/
http://localhost:5000/text-files
http://localhost:5000/text-files/2023-01-25-13-29-24.txt.
